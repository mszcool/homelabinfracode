# Terraform Hyper-V Provider Setup - Complete HTTPS Solution

## Overview
This solution configures Terraform Hyper-V provider to work with WinRM on Windows 11 using **HTTPS-only connections** with self-signed certificates and a dedicated service account with minimal privileges, avoiding the need for Administrator access or Microsoft Account integration.

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: "WSMan service could not launch a host process" error when using Terraform Hyper-V provider
- **Issue**: "Unencrypted traffic is disabled" errors with modern WinRM configurations
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient WinRM permissions and missing "Log on as a service" rights for the service account
- **Solution**: Complete WinRM HTTPS configuration with proper user rights assignment and SSL encryption

## Key Improvements Made

### WinRM HTTPS Permissions Configuration

```powershell
# 1. "Log on as a service" rights via Security Policy
secedit /export /cfg $tempPolicyFile /areas USER_RIGHTS
# Modify SeServiceLogonRight to include service account SID
secedit /configure /db $tempDbFile /cfg $tempPolicyFile /areas USER_RIGHTS

# 2. WinRM Security Descriptor (SDDL) modification
$aceForUser = "(A;;GA;;;$($sid.Value))"  # Generic All access
winrm set winrm/config/service @{RootSDDL="$newSDDL"}

# 3. WinRM HTTPS service configuration
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="false"}  # HTTPS only
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth @{Basic="true"}

# 4. Self-signed certificate creation
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName @("localhost", "127.0.0.1", $env:COMPUTERNAME) `
                         -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" `
                         -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(5)

# 5. HTTPS listener creation
winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS @{Hostname="localhost";CertificateThumbprint="$thumbprint"}
```

### Service Account Security

- **Groups**: Only "Hyper-V Administrators" and "Remote Management Users"
- **Rights**: Only "Log on as a service" (no interactive login)
- **Scope**: Local machine access only
- **Protocol**: WinRM/HTTPS with self-signed certificates (secure encrypted communication)
- **Firewall**: Port 5986 (HTTPS) with automatic rule creation

### Error Resolution

The "WSMan service could not launch a host process" and "unencrypted traffic disabled" errors were resolved by:

1. ✅ Granting "Log on as a service" user right
2. ✅ Configuring WinRM Security Descriptor properly
3. ✅ Setting up HTTPS-only WinRM with self-signed certificates
4. ✅ Creating Windows Firewall rules for port 5986
5. ✅ Setting up DCOM/WMI permissions for Hyper-V access
6. ✅ Idempotent certificate management with validation
7. ✅ Restarting WinRM service after configuration

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Run Setup (as Administrator)
```powershell
# Interactive password prompt (recommended)
$username = "terraform-hyperv"
$password = Read-Host "Enter password for $username" -AsSecureString
.\Prepare-HyperV.ps1 -ServiceUsername $username -ServicePassword $password
```

### 2. Restart Computer
**CRITICAL**: Restart required for user rights to take effect

### 3. Test Connectivity
```powershell
$password = Read-Host -AsSecureString 'Service account password'
.\Test-TerraformConnectivity.ps1 -ServiceUsername 'terraform-hyperv' -ServicePassword $password
```

### 4. Use with Terraform

```hcl
provider "hyperv" {
  user     = "terraform-hyperv"
  password = "your-secure-password"
  host     = "127.0.0.1"
  port     = 5986
  https    = true
  insecure = true  # Accept self-signed certificates
  use_ntlm = true
  timeout  = "30s"
}
  insecure = true
  use_ntlm = true
  timeout  = "30s"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### MAXIMUM SECURITY Configuration

The `Prepare-HyperV.ps1` script implements **MAXIMUM SECURITY** DCOM/WMI configuration:

**WMI Namespace Security Levels:**

- `root` - **Minimal** access (read-only queries only)
- `root/cimv2` - **Standard** access (system information)
- `root/virtualization/v2` - **HyperV** access (targeted Hyper-V operations)
- `root/Microsoft/Windows/HyperV` - **HyperV** access (advanced management)
- `root/interop` - **Standard** access (interoperability)
- `root/StandardCimv2` - **Standard** access (CIM operations)

**DCOM Maximum Security:**

- **PKT_PRIVACY** authentication (strongest encryption)
- **IDENTIFY** impersonation level (secure boundary)
- **Anonymous access DISABLED** (security hardening)
- **Minimal launch permissions** (principle of least privilege)

**Essential Windows Privileges (Minimal Required):**

- `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` - VHD/VHDX operations (CRITICAL)
- `SeManageVolumePrivilege` - Storage operations (CRITICAL)
- `SeSecurityPrivilege` - Secure VM operations (CRITICAL)
- `SeSystemProfilePrivilege` - Performance monitoring (OPTIONAL)
- `SeCreatePageFilePrivilege` - Memory management (OPTIONAL)

### Production Environment

```powershell
# Use environment variables for credentials
$env:HYPERV_USER = "terraform-hyperv"
$env:HYPERV_PASSWORD = "YourSecurePassword123!"

# In Terraform with maximum security
provider "hyperv" {
  user     = var.hyperv_user
  password = var.hyperv_password
  host     = "127.0.0.1"
  port     = 5986
  https    = true
  insecure = true  # Self-signed certificate (secure in isolated network)
  use_ntlm = true
  timeout  = "30s"
}
```

### Security Validation

```powershell
# Test maximum security configuration
$password = Read-Host -AsSecureString 'Service account password'
.\Test-MaxSecurityDCOMWMI.ps1 -ServiceUsername 'terraform-hyperv' -ServicePassword (ConvertFrom-SecureString $password -AsPlainText)
```

### Password Management

- Use strong passwords (16+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Implement password rotation policies (90-day maximum)
- Store credentials securely (Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Never store credentials in plain text configuration files

## Troubleshooting

### If WinRM Tests Still Fail
1. **Verify Administrator execution**: Script must run as Administrator
2. **Check reboot status**: User rights require restart to take effect
3. **Review Event Logs**: Check Windows Event Logs → Applications and Services → Microsoft → Windows → WinRM
4. **Validate service account**: Ensure password is correct and account is not disabled
5. **Group Policy refresh**: Run `gpupdate /force`

### Common Error Messages
- **"WSMan service could not launch a host process"** → Need reboot after user rights assignment
- **"Access denied"** → Service account needs to be in correct groups
- **"Authentication failed"** → Check password and NTLM configuration
- **"Connection refused"** → WinRM listener not configured or firewall blocking

## Architecture Diagram
```
[Terraform] → [WinRM HTTPS:5986] → [Service Account] → [Hyper-V]
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
  providers.tf  → Port 5986         → Groups:         → VM Management
  use_ntlm=true   SSL Encrypted       • Hyper-V Admins   Operations
  insecure=true   Self-signed cert    • Remote Mgmt      
                                     Rights:
                                     • Log on as service
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ WinRM HTTPS listeners active on port 5986
- ✅ Service account can authenticate via WinRM with SSL encryption
- ✅ Self-signed certificates working with Terraform provider
- ✅ Hyper-V operations accessible through secure remote session
- ✅ Terraform can connect and manage Hyper-V resources over HTTPS
- ✅ No Administrator privileges required for Terraform operations

## Next Steps
1. Test Terraform with actual VM resources
2. Implement Infrastructure as Code for your Hyper-V environment
3. Consider CI/CD integration with the service account credentials
4. Monitor and maintain the service account (password rotation, etc.)
